my first pygmae is a game in which a charator is put in the middel of the screen and he 
had to avoid getting hit by the enemy if the enemy touches you then the game is over
the "YOU LOSE" and when all the enemys leave the screen the text "YOU WIN" is displayed
on the screen.the character moves in the direction of the keys you press,
the character also changes into the direction that you are pressing your keys to and 
when the keys are not pressed the charater stands still
